## üß† **Abstract**  
**Meat Cogito** is a single-player, narrative-driven psychological horror game that merges **body horror** with **Cartesian philosophy**.  

### **The Premise**  
You awaken as a **disembodied brain** in a surreal simulation where:  
- **Flesh constructs reality** (walls pulse, NPCs whisper your deepest doubts)  
- **Every choice mutates your form** (build a "human" body... or something *else*)  
- **The system fights back** (glitching UI, meta crashes, *Project VERI* propaganda)  

### **The Questions**  
- *"If I think, am I?"*  
- *"Is my body real, or just a perception?"*  
- *"Will becoming ‚Äòhuman‚Äô save me... or trap me?"*  

### **The Experience**  
- **Grotesque 3D Environments:** Explore shifting organic spaces (Blender + Unity HDRP)  
- **Unsettling Interactions:** Rotate/toss objects with *Resident Evil*-inspired weight  
- **Three Endings:** Become a *True Being*, transcend as pure thought, or **shatter the simulation**  

### **Technical Execution**  
- **Solo-Developed** in Unity (C#) with custom:  
  - 3D models (Blender)  
  - VHS-style cutscenes (DaVinci Resolve)  
  - Glitch UI (Photoshop + Shader Graph)  
- **Philosophical Framework:** Choices reflect Descartes‚Äô *cogito* paradoxes  

> *"A horror game that deletes itself‚Äîbecause the scariest ending is waking up."*

- Game "crashes" itself as narrative device  

### 2. **Player Avatar & Interaction**  
- 3D brain avatar with Blender-modeled animations  
- Objects react to being examined (pickup/rotate/toss)  
- Spaceship corridor meltdown sequence  

### 3. **Philosophical Terror**  
```csharp
// Example from Humanity Test:
new Question() {
    questionText = "7. Which of these is the real version of you?",
    answers = new string[] { "This one", "The reflection", "The one in the file", "None are left" }
}
```
